# FastestLocklessQueue
This is a robust lockless queue used in multi processes through shared memory. 
It can deal with the situation that any programs abort at any line.
It's not the fastest lockless queue but the most robust one.
It's called FastedLocklessQueue because it's hard to change the name in Github. :)))
Welcome to show your better ideas.
